## Why a Reddit bot?
The UIUC subreddit [r/UIUC](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/) is the biggest university subreddit in the U.S., with thousands of students asking about course advice, schedule checks and professor experiences every day. [RateMyProfessor](LINK) is used by college students all across the country to share their learning preferences, and the professor-student dynamic has become increasingly important in a virtual college setting.

Being a premier public university, many UIUC professors have amassed student reviews, and we think that new students could benefit from the advice of their senior peers catalogued on their site. With such a strong correlation of RateMyProfessor and the topics discussed on r/UIUC, we are optimistic that the ability to quickly see instructor ratings by simply calling our bot is a convenient and helpful addition to the subreddit and UIUC students as a whole.
